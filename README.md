# SpectrumSensingforRadiosurveillance
In this project, algorithms to perform non-collaborative radiolocalization were developed and tested through software defined radios. The algorithms generated are hybrid TDoA/DoA approaches, that promise to have better performance than simplistic approaches.

Different implementations are available in the following way:

DoA: implemented in octave, python, python linked with GRC and matlab.
TDoA: synchronization squemes for TDoA approaches, solutions through classical methods.
